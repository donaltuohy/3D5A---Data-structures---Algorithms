# Data structures & algorithms module

The assignments given for this module are described below.


<h2>Hash Table Assignment</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Implement a double-hashing hash table in C or C++ with your own hash functions.
    Evaluate it against typical criteria using some test data.
    Write a brief summary.</li>
  <li>Find an interesting implementation of a hash table.
    Review it in a formal written report.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Sorting Assignment</h2>
<ol>
  <li> Implement any sorting algorithm of your choice and also implement quicksort. </li>
  <li> Comment your code to demonstrate you understand the sorting process. Summarise each sort in
    your report to show your understanding of each algorithm and how this relates to your code. </li>
<li> Create an array of test data to run your sorting functions on. You may manually assign array
  values, or generate them randomly. e.g. an array of integers. </li>
<li>Count the number of investigated elements or probes made by each of the search functions on
  the test data. </li>
<li>Put the results in a table comparing your implementations, giving your test results, and the big-O
complexities. State the size of the test array used, and if it was randomly distributed, mostly
  sorted, or sorted but in reverse. </li>
</ol>
