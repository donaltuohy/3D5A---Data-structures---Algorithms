# Data structures & algorithms module

The assignments given for this module are described below.


<h2>Hash Table Assignment</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Implement a double-hashing hash table in C or C++ with your own hash functions.
    Evaluate it against typical criteria using some test data.
    Write a brief summary.</li>
  <li>Find an interesting implementation of a hash table.
    Review it in a formal written report.</li>
</ol>

</ul>

<h2>Sorting Assignment</h2>
<ol>
  <li> Implement any sorting algorithm of your choice and also implement quicksort. </li>
  <li> Comment your code to demonstrate you understand the sorting process. Summarise each sort in
    your report to show your understanding of each algorithm and how this relates to your code. </li>
<li> Create an array of test data to run your sorting functions on. You may manually assign array
  values, or generate them randomly. e.g. an array of integers. </li>
<li>Count the number of investigated elements or probes made by each of the search functions on
  the test data. </li>
<li>Put the results in a table comparing your implementations, giving your test results, and the big-O
complexities. State the size of the test array used, and if it was randomly distributed, mostly
  sorted, or sorted but in reverse. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Binary Search Tree Assignment</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The goal of this assignment is to build a program with the data structure
    and functions of a typical binary search tree.</li>
</ol>

</ul>

<h2>Dijkstra's Algorithm Assignment</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The goal of this assignment is to write a program that represents the graph, shown in Figure 1, as
    a data structure, and write C or C++ implementations of Depth-First Search and Dijkstraâ€™s
    Algorithm, which you will then call to traverse the graph. </li>
  <li>Exact input and output requirements are given. Comment out any test code that produces other
    output before submission.</li>
   <li>Traversal sequences should be correct with respect to your system for ordering the edges - therefore
    the correct sequence for your program might not exactly match the example output.
    Do not use any pre-made graph data structures or algorithms from libraries e.g. from Boost.</li>
</ol>
